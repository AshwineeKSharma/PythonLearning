#Tuples are the immutable data containers to store data where user cannot update the given data inside it.

# Creating tuples using ()
tup=(1,3,5,7,9)

# Printing the values of the assigned tuple.
print(tup)

# Printing the value of the assigned tuple using index

# Empty Tuple
t=()

# Tuple with single element but needs a comma at the end. t1=(1) is a wrong way to declare a tuple
t1=(1,)

# Tuple with multiple elements
